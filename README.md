The report provides a general overview of two of the most important things college students worry about: picking majors while in the college and paying back loans after college. With the audience of incoming and current college students in mind, this report with data set from all the colleges over the United States will give students some inspiration of majors to pick and a general financial planning after college. We want to use this data set to dispel some misunderstanding and present the data visually to the audience. We wish this data set will inspire audience to pick the major they are interested in but not that most popular major and prepare audience for post college loan repayment plan
